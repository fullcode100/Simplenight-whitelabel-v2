                    "description": "Ecolimo pioneered the introduction of environmentally friendlier hire car and limousine services in Australia. Established in Melbourne in 2006 we started out with the luxurious hybrid Lexus GS450H which produces 45% less CO2 emissions than a standard limousine. A Carbon Neutral Company.\r\n\r\nStill, we wanted to offer an even more environmentally friendly choice and although the Toyota Prius fit the bill, the size of the Prius wheel base did not comply with State laws applied to the hire car industry in both NSW and Victoria.\r\nNever one to turn our back on a challenge, Ecolimo lobbied governments in NSW and Victoria to change the law as it no longer reflected community sentiments. Finally in late 2007 the law was changed in NSW enabling Ecolimo to create an even greener choice hire car and limousine service for environmentally discerning Sydneysiders. And so in January 2008, for the first time ever in Australia, the Toyota Prius was used officially as a hire car by Ecolimo.\r\n\r\nFollowing the change in regulation in NSW, we knew that it was only a matter of time before Victoria followed suit and when it did in June 2008, we promptly added two Prius to our Melbourne fleet. After all, we didn’t want anyone to think we were playing favourites.\r\nEcolimo prides itself on its environmentally accountable business practices. We choose to be a carbon neutral company, purchasing carbon credits from Climate Friendly to offset our carbon emissions and fund renewable energy projects throughout the world.",
